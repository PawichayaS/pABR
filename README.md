This repo contains code in Matlab and Python for analyzing parallel auditory brainstem response (pABR) recordings as originally conceived by Polonenko and Maddox (Trends in Hearing, 2019).

There are functions for creating the sounds and functions for analyzing the recordings. 

An example dataset is included to demonstrate the analysis functions. Each file "Example_Voltage_And_Triggers_X" in the dataset contains a recording made in response to sounds presented at X dB SPL along with onset indices for 1000 tones at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16kHz. (Note that the sampling rates for our sounds and recordings are the same (44.1kHz); if you use different sampling rates for your sounds and recordings you will need to update the code to account for that.)
